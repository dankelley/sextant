# Sextant

The goal of this project is to provide software for creating simple
home-made sextants that can be used to find the heights of trees,
buildings, or hills.

Importantly, these sextants **cannot** be used to take readings of the
sun, because they do not provide a light-blocking mechanism that guards
against eye damage.

Please see <https://dankelley.github.io/sextant/articles/sextant.html>
for details of constructing and using these sextants.
