</h2>
<p>A sextant is an instrument for measuring angles between objects. They
have been used in navigation for centuries, because latitude can be
inferred from a measurement of the angle between the horizon and the
noontime sun. For this reason, professional sextants have a way of
sighting the sun angle without looking at the sun.</p>
<p>This sun-observation method is <strong>certainly NOT</strong> a
possibility with the sextant described below, because it lacks a
sun-blocking mechanism, and looking directly at the sun is
<strong>extremely</strong> dangerous.</p>
<p>The purpose of the sextant provided here is to for use in finding
angles (with respect to the horizontal), which allows a person to infer
the heights of flagpoles, buildings, and even hills, by measuring a
horizontal distance and one or two angles.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="a-homemade-sextant">A homemade sextant<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#a-homemade-sextant"></a>
</h2>
<p>A crude sextant measuring angles with respect to the horizontal plane
can be used to determine the heights of objects, using a method invented
a thousand years ago by Al Biruni (see Peter Lynch’s blog posting “Al
Biruni and the Size of the Earth.” ThatsMaths, June 10, 2021. <a href="https://thatsmaths.com/2021/06/10/al-biruni-and-the-size-of-the-earth/" class="external-link uri">https://thatsmaths.com/2021/06/10/al-biruni-and-the-size-of-the-earth/</a>).
Carrying out such measurements and performing the associated
calculations can be a fun way to spend some time outside, and it’s also
a good way to see that high-school trigonometry can be useful!</p>
<p>To make the sextant, follow these steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Print either <a href="https://github.com/dankelley/sextant/raw/main/man/figures/sextant1.pdf" class="external-link uri">https://github.com/dankelley/sextant/raw/main/man/figures/sextant1.pdf</a>
or <a href="https://github.com/dankelley/sextant/raw/main/man/figures/sextant2.pdf" class="external-link uri">https://github.com/dankelley/sextant/raw/main/man/figures/sextant2.pdf</a>
on a sheet of paper. (These files differ in how the angles are laid out.
Pick whichever one you find easier to read.)</li>
<li>Paste or tape this PDF file onto a piece of cardboard or thin
wood.</li>
<li>If you wish, cut along the gray outer semicircle, to eliminate
corners.</li>
<li>Create a pivot at the point marked “P”. If the sextant is mounted on
wood, a pivot can be made with half-hammered nail, or a thin dowel
(perhaps a round toothpick) inserted into a pre-drilled hole. If it is
mounted on a piece of corrugated cardboard, a round toothpick can
inserted by hand. In either case, the pivot must be inserted at right
angles to the plane of the sextant. To keep it so aligned, try using
some glue.</li>
<li>Attach fishing line, sewing thread, or thin string, at the “P”
pivot. The line should be long enough to extend past the bottom of the
sextant. Attach something relatively small but heavy at the free end,
which will weigh the line down, making it run vertically along the
sextant, pointing in the downward direction. A bolt or washer is a good
choice since you can attach it by tying a knot, but you could also use a
heavy coin, attached by tape.</li>
<li>Insert a mail, dowel or toothpick at the spot marked “S” (the
sighting spot).</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="taking-angle-readings">Taking angle readings<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#taking-angle-readings"></a>
</h2>
<p>Hold the sextant vertically, with the plumb line extending down to
the round scale. Then position it so that you can sight an object of
interest. Rotate it in the vertical plane until the “P” and “S” points
are aligned with the object. You might need to wait a second or two for
the plumb bob to stop moving. When it does, press your finger on the
line, below the scale. Holding your finger there, turn the sextant so
that you can read off the angle at the spot where the plumb line
intersects the round scale. This is the angle along the sighting line,
with respect to the horizontal plane.</p>

<h2 id="height-of-object-at-known-distance">Height of object at known distance<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#height-of-object-at-known-distance"></a>
</h2>
<p>This method can be used to find the height of an object at a known
distance, measured across a level plane. It requires making only a
single angle measurement.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="https://github.com/dankelley/sextant/raw/main/man/figures/fig1.png" alt=""><p class="caption">Figure 1. Definition sketch for the computation of
the height of a object on level terrain. <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> is the height to be computed, while
<span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> is a measured distance along the
ground, and <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> is the angle
found by sighting from the marked point to the top of the object.</p>
</div>
<p>As illustrated in Figure 1 above, you can find the height <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> of a flagpole, tree, building, etc., on
flat ground, by pacing off a horizontal distance <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> from it’s base, and then finding the
angle <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> to the top. (You may
determine <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> by counting how many
paces it takes you to cover 10 sidewalk stones, and then using a ruler
to measure one stone to get a conversion factor.) With <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> now known, you may calculate the
object height above the sighting plan as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
h = L\tan\theta
\]</span></p>
<p>so that the height of the object above the ground is given by</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
H = h_e + L\tan\theta
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(h_e\)</span> is the height of your
eye above the ground. Note that <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>
may be measured in “pace” units, converted to metres (or feet) using a
calibration factor developed by pacing out a number of sidewalk paving
stones, then measuring the length of one of them with a ruler.</p>
<p>If you don’t have a calculator handy, you may use the table in the
Appendix to get the <span class="math inline">\(\tan\theta\)</span>, and
carry out the calculation by hand to a couple of digits. (As an
exercise, repeat the pace-measure-calculate exercise a few times, to get
an idea of the uncertainty of the method.)</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="height-of-object-at-unknown-distance">Height of object at unknown distance<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#height-of-object-at-unknown-distance"></a>
</h2>
<p>This method can be used to find the height of an object at a unknown
distance, so long as distance can be measured along locally flat
terrain. Two angles must be measured, one at the near end of this local
terrain and the other at the far end.</p>
<p>In the case of a sloping hill, it is difficult to measure the
horizontal distance between the top of the hill and the observer. Pacing
a distance off gives distance along the slope, which is not the same as
distance in the horizontal direction. But we need the horizontal
distance to use the formula from Example 1. What to do?</p>
<p>Trigonometry can come to the rescue, provided that there is a flat
plain nearby. Just measure the angles at two spots on that plain, along
with the distance between them. (Pacing works in this case because the
ground is level.)</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="https://github.com/dankelley/sextant/raw/main/man/figures/fig2.png" alt=""><p class="caption">Figure 2. Definition sketch for the two-angle case.
<span class="math inline">\(L_1\)</span> is an unknown distance, and
<span class="math inline">\(L_2\)</span> is a known distance. Angles
<span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> are measured by sighting the top of
the object from the two marked points.</p>
</div>
<p>Consider the figure above, in which the two angles are <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span>, the first being the value observed
nearer the hill. The distance between the observation spots is <span class="math inline">\(L_2\)</span>. This may be measured by pacing off
distance along the flat plain, as a horizontal distance was measured in
Example 1.</p>
<p>In this case, then, the goal is to infer hill height from
measurements of <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(L_2\)</span>.</p>
<p>If we knew <span class="math inline">\(L_1\)</span>, we could apply
the method of Example 1 at both spots, giving two estimates of height.
However, we cannot determine <span class="math inline">\(L_1\)</span>
without without tunneling through the hill, so we cannot use the formula
for <em>either</em> spot.</p>
<p>Luckily, a little trigonometry can save us a lot of tunneling! At the
nearby spot we have</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
h = L_1\tan\theta
\]</span></p>
<p>and at the farther-away spot we have</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
h = (L_1\ +\ L_2)\tan\phi
\]</span></p>
<p>but these must yield the same <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>
value, so we can combine the two equations, yielding</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
L_1 \tan\theta  = (L_1\ +\ L_2)\tan\phi
\]</span></p>
<p>which can be rearranged to</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
L_1 (\tan\theta\ -\ \tan\phi) = L_2\ \tan\phi
\]</span></p>
<p>and then to</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
L_1 = L_2 \frac{\tan\phi}{\tan\theta-\tan\phi}
\]</span></p>
<p>at which point we have a formula for the unknown distance <span class="math inline">\(L_1\)</span>, based on the easily-measured <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(L_2\)</span>. (This illustrates the magic of
mathematics, for we found that answer just by moving symbols around,
instead of visualizing calculations.)</p>
<p>Now, we can use this result our original formula for height at the
nearby spot, to get</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
H = h_e + L_2 \frac{\tan\theta\ \tan\phi}{\tan\theta-\tan\phi}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>to get the height of the object above the ground. Here, again, <span class="math inline">\(h_e\)</span> is the height of your eye above the
ground.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="a-test-case">A test case<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#a-test-case"></a>
</h2>
<p>The method was used to to estimate a downward distance, sighting from
an apartment window to the base of a nearby building. For an independent
value, I calculated the observation height as <span class="math inline">\(17.0\)</span>m <span class="math inline">\(\pm
0.5\)</span>m, based on my stature together with an estimate of the
elevation of the first floor above ground-level, and taking into account
the floor from which I made the observation.</p>
<p>A map from <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org" class="external-link uri">https://www.openstreetmap.org</a> revealed the horizontal
distance to be <span class="math inline">\(L=43 \pm 1\)</span>m. The
sextant gave <span class="math inline">\(\theta=20^\circ \pm
1^\circ\)</span> as the downward angle. These values gave the height of
my eye as <span class="math inline">\(17.2\pm 1.2\)</span>m.</p>
<p>In this test case, the height estimates based on floor count and
sextant angle are in agreement, to within the measurement
uncertainty.</p>

<p>This table shows the <span class="math inline">\(\tan\theta\)</span>
for <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> ranging from 0 to
89<span class="math inline">\(^\circ\)</span>. To find the value for a
given angle, scan down to the row labelled with the first digit of <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> (after adding a <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> to the left of angles below <span class="math inline">\(10^\circ\)</span>), and then scan across to the
column labelled with the second digit. For example, the tangent of <span class="math inline">\(21^\circ\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(0.383864\)</span>, which, after rounding, matches
the value in the third row and second column.</p>
