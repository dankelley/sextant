# Professional sextants

A sextant is an instrument for measuring angles between objects. They have been
used in navigation for centuries, because latitude can be inferred from a
measurement of the angle between the horizon and the noontime sun. For this
reason, professional sextants have a way of sighting the sun angle without
looking at the sun.

This sun-observation method is **certainly NOT** a possibility with the sextant
described below, because it lacks a sun-blocking mechanism, and looking
directly at the sun is **extremely** dangerous.

The purpose of the sextant provided here is to for use in finding angles (with
respect to the horizontal), which allows a person to infer the heights of
flagpoles, buildings, and even hills, by measuring a horizontal distance and
one or two angles.

# A homemade sextant

A crude sextant measuring angles with respect to the horizontal plane can be
used to determine the heights of objects, using a method invented a thousand
years ago by Al Biruni (see Peter Lynch's blog posting “Al Biruni and the Size
of the Earth.” ThatsMaths, June 10, 2021.
https://thatsmaths.com/2021/06/10/al-biruni-and-the-size-of-the-earth/).
Carrying out such measurements and performing the associated calculations can
be a fun way to spend some time outside, and it's also a good way to see that
high-school trigonometry can be useful!

To make the sextant, follow these steps:

1. Print either the file named [sextant1.pdf](sextant1.pdf) or the one named
   [sextant2.pdf](sextant2.pdf) on a sheet of paper. (These files differ in how
   the angles are laid out. Pick whichever one you find easier to read.)
2. Paste or tape this PDF file onto a piece of cardboard or thin wood.
3. If you wish, cut along the gray outer semicircle, to eliminate corners.
4. Create a pivot at the point marked "P". If the sextant is mounted
   on wood, a pivot can be made with half-hammered nail, or a thin dowel (perhaps
   a round toothpick) inserted into a pre-drilled hole. If it is mounted on
   a piece of corrugated cardboard, a round toothpick can inserted by hand.
   In either case, the pivot must be inserted at right angles to the plane of
   the sextant.  To keep it so aligned, try using some glue.
5. Attach fishing line, sewing thread, or thin string, at the "P" pivot. The
   line should be long enough to extend past the bottom of the sextant.
   Attach something relatively small but heavy at the free end, which
   will weigh the line down, making it run vertically along the sextant,
   pointing in the downward direction. A bolt or washer is a good choice
   since you can attach it by tying a knot, but you could also use a heavy
   coin, attached by tape.
6. Insert a mail, dowel or toothpick at the spot marked "S" (the sighting
   spot).

# Taking angle readings

Hold it vertically, with the plumb line extending down to the round scale. Then
position it so that you can sight an object of interest.  Rotate it in the
vertical plane until the "P" and "S" points are aligned with the object. You
might need to wait a second or two for the plumb bob to stop moving.  When it
does, press your finger on the line, below the scale.  Holding your finger
there, turn the sextant so that you can read off the angle at the spot where
the plumb line intersects the round scale.  This is the angle along the
sighting line, with respect to the horizontal plane.

## Example 1: height of an object on a flat plain

![Figure 1. Diagram for measuring the height of a flagpole (or tree, or
building, etc) on a flat plane.  $L$ is a distance paced off on the ground,
$\theta$ is the angle found by sighting to the top of the object, and
$H=L\tan\theta$ is the inferred height.](fig1.png)

As illustrated above, you can find the height $H$ of a flagpole, tree,
building, etc., on flat ground, by pacing off a horizontal distance $L$ from
it's base, and then finding the angle $\theta$ to the top. The height above is
then given by
\begin{equation}
H = H_e + L\tan\theta
\end{equation}
where $H_e$ is the height of your eye above the ground, which you may take to
be your height.  Note that the result will be in "pace" units, but you can
convert that easily to metres or feet by counting the number of paces you take
to cross some number of sidewalk paving stones, then measuring the length of
one stone with a ruler, to develop a conversion factor.

If you don't have a calculator handy, you may use the table in the Appendix to
get the $\tan\theta$, and carry out the calculation by hand to a couple of
digits.  (As an exercise, repeat the pace-measure-calculate exercise a few
times, to get an idea of the uncertainty of the method.)



## Example 2: hill height

In the case of a sloping hill, it is difficult to measure the horizontal
distance between the top of the hill and the observer.  Pacing a distance off
gives distance along the slope, which is not the same as distance in the
horizontal direction.  But we need the horizontal distance to use the formula
from Example 1.  What to do?

Trigonometry can come to the rescue, provided that there is a flat plain nearby.
Just measure the angles at two spots on that plain, along with the distance
between them.  (Pacing works in this case because the ground is level.)

![Figure 2. Definition sketch for two-angle case.](fig2.png)

Consider the figure above, in which the two angles are $\theta$ and $\phi$, the
first being the value observed nearer the hill.  The distance between the
observation spots is $L_2$.  This may be measured by pacing off distance along
the flat plain, as a horizontal distance was measured in Example 1.

In this case, then, the goal is to infer hill height $H$ from measurements of
$\theta$, $\phi$, and $L_2$.

If we knew $L_1$, we could apply the method of Example 1 at both spots, giving
two estimates of height.  However, we cannot determine $L_1$ without without
tunneling through the hill, so we cannot use the formula for *either* spot.

Tunneling is hard work.  But trigonometry can save us that work!  Let's write
formulas for the height inferred from the two observations.  At the nearby spot
we have

\[
H = H_e + L_1\tan\theta
\]

and at the farther-away spot we have

\[
H = H_e + (L_1\ +\ L_2)\tan\phi
\]

but these must yield the same $H$ value, so we can combine the two equations,
yielding

\[
L_1 \tan\theta  = (L_1\ +\ L_2)\tan\phi
\]

which can be rearranged to

\[
L_1 (\tan\theta\ -\ \tan\phi) = L_2\ \tan\phi
\]

and then to

\[
L_1 = L_2 \ \tan\phi\ /\ (\tan\theta\ -\ \tan\phi)
\]

at which point we have a formula for the unknown distance $L_1$, based on the
easily-measured $\theta$, $\phi$ and $L_2$.  (Wow, the magic of mathematics!)

Now, we can use this result our original formula for height at the nearby
spot, to get

\begin{equation}
H = H_e + L_2\ (\tan\theta\ \tan\phi)\ /\ (\tan\theta\ -\ \tan\phi)
\end{equation}
where, again, $H_e$ is the height of you eye above the ground.


```{r echo=FALSE}
theta <- atan2(1, 1-0.5)
phi <- atan2(1, 1)
thetaDeg <- round(theta * 180/pi, 0)
phiDeg <- round(phi * 180/pi, 0)
L2 <- 50
H <- L2 * tan(theta)*tan(phi)/(tan(theta)-tan(phi))
stopifnot(abs(H == 100) < 1e-7)
```


As an example, print the illustration above and use a protractor to measure
angles and a ruler to measure $L_2$.  The protractor should reveal that
$\theta=`r thetaDeg`^\circ$ and $\phi=`r phiDeg`^\circ$.  The formula then
reveals that the ratio of $H$ to $L_2$ is `r H/L2`.  You can check this with a
ruler.  As a further exercise, draw a diagram like the one above, but with
different angles, and see if the formula gives the correct $H$, given your
drawing. Indeed, a good way to understand this might be to try a sequence of
tests cases.  You will see that inferring $H$ can be difficult, for certain
angle ranges, and this is something worth thinking about.

# Appendix: trigonometry tables

Note that sine and cosine are given here in addition to tangent.  This is
because you might find them useful for related calculations.

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
angle <- seq(0, 89, 1)
sine <- sin(angle*pi/180)
cosine <- cos(angle*pi/180)
tangent <- tan(angle*pi/180)
df <- data.frame(angle,sine, cosine, tangent)
kable(df, digits=5)
