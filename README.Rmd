This site provides software for drawing simple home-made sextants, which might
be used to find the heights of trees, buildings, or hills.  They **cannot**
be used to take readings of the sun, however, owing to the near-certainty of
permanent eye damage by looking at the sun.  Therefore, these sextants cannot
be used for the normal purpose of navigational sextants.

Please see the vignette at
https://dankelley.github.io/sextant/articles/sextant.html for the details of
constructing and using these sextants.
